# sflean.github.io

Hello! We're a friendly Lean study group that meets at Mox SF on Mondays at 19:00 in late 2025 and early 2026. Our goal is to formalize the first five chapters of Terence Tao's Analysis textbook together in Lean.

If you have time before you arrive, try installing the [Natual Number Game](https://github.com/leanprover-community/NNG4) locally. You'll want to open the repo in a VSCode devcontainer and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

If you'd like to skip straight to the math, clone Terrence Tao's repo:
1. `git clone https://github.com/teorth/analysis`
2. `cd analysis/analysis`
3. `lake exe cache get`
4. Start poking around `Section_2_2.lean` and filling out the `sorry`s.

Good luck! You can ask for help / check the next meeting in the Discord
server, which you can join by concatenating `https://discord.gg/` and
`bXNPh` and `Qyjfe` and pasting into your browser.
